Term Project TCP/UDP Network Description	

The objective for this project is to create a TCP/UDP Client-Server Network that provides basic services to multiple clients that are connected to the same network. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses a three-way handshake protocol, by initiating and acknowledging a connection and by transferring data until the connection is terminated. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is mainly used for broadcasting the network transmission and is much faster than TCP. Both protocols use sockets to transfer information and break down large data into small packets until they reach their destination. Also, TCP handles error detection and UDP does not. For this project we were also assigned to implement a ClientHandler and ClientHelper class to help the server and client communicate with each other. The client-handler is the middleman between the server and the client as well as the client-helper, which helps the client communicate with the server. So the server and client use these classes to communicate with each other rather than directly interacting with each other.
